        <h2>About the Legend</h2>
        <p>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR was an Indian aerospace
          scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from
          2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil
          Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
          administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
          Organisation

          and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
          military missile development efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
          He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on
          the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He
          also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
          India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
          nuclear test by India in 1974.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
          support of both the ruling
          <span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 185)"> Bharatiya Janata Party</span>
          and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to
          as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of
          education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
          recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
          India's highest civilian honour.

          <p class="para5">
            On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian
            Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet
            colleagues <br /><br /><br />

            Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy
            victory and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in
            on 25 July.

        <p>
          During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the
          People's President,[52][53][54] saying that signing the Office of
          Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.
          [55][56][57] Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the
          fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his
          tenure.[58] Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the
          President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death
          sentence of convicts on death row.[58][59] Kalam acted on only one
          mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of
          rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.[58] Perhaps the
          most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was
          convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian
          Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in
          2004.[59] While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20
          October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him
          remaining on death row.[59] He also took the controversial decision to
          impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.[60]

        <div class="kalam-expressed">
          <p>
            At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his
            willingness to consider a second term in office provided there was
            certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[65]
            <br />
            However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential
            election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati
            Bhavan from any political processes.[66] <br />
            He was proposed by third front named United National Progressive
            Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu
            other leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, <br />
            but he did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and
            UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.[67][68]

                <p>After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;[80] chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.[81]
                 In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people.[82] The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.[83]</p>
